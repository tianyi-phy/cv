## Research Experience

### **Cosmological data analysis with simulation-based inference** `2022.6 - present`

_Master's Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Christoph Weniger_<br>



### **Reconstruction of the perturbation of the metric near horizon and its quantum deviation** `2022.6 - present`

_Master's Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Ben Freivogel_<br>
There is a type of proposal that the geometry near the horizon of a black hole is different for different black hole microstates, which may even be detected by gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. In this project, we try to impose constraints on the order of magnitude of this quantum perturbation. I am almost done with the first step, mapping the operator of the perturbed metric to the boundary stress tensor using AdS/CFT. The next step is to use quantum deviation, a quantity proposed by Ben Freivogel et.al., to measure the fluctuation of this boudnary operator.


### **Holographic derivation of the island formula for reflected entropy** `2021.1 - 2021.8`

_Undergraduate Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Yang Zhou_<br>
This research leads to the publication 1. We employ the quantum gravity model proposed in our previous work to give a holographic derivation of the island formula for reflected entropy. More precisely, we demonstrate that the entropy calculated on the boundary side is equivalent to a bulk quantity called "defect extremal cross section" by combining the partial Randall-Sundrum reduction and holographic duality. We find perfect agreement in both static and time-dependent scenarios. 

### **Refected entropy of Hawking radiation** `2020.1 - 2020.6`

_Undergraduate Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Yang Zhou_<br>
This research leads to the publication 2. We study the reflected entropy as a correlated measure of mixed states in the process of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we compute the reflected entropy between radiation and black hole in three different models and study its behavior in the whole evaporation process. Moreover, inspired by the recent island formula, we propose a generalized formula for reflected entropy with island cross section as its area term. This formula reveals some interesting information features of the island. 

### **Machine learning of phase transitions in spin models** `2019.8 - 2019.12`

_Undergraduate Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Yan Chen_<br>
We apply machine learning methods to study the phase transition in XY model and 3-dimensional Ising model. Samples of the model at different temperature, distributed on both sides of the critical point, are generated by the Monte Carlo algorithm. By exemplifying and simulating the XY model, we exhibit a new method, which integrates Monte Carlo, VAE and neural network algorithm to help describe the phase transition and accurately estimate their critical point.

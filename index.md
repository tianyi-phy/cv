## Research Experience

### **Holographic derivation of the island formula for reflected entropy** `2021.1 - 2021.8`

_Undergraduate Research    Advisor: Prof. Yang Zhou_<br>
We employ the quantum gravity model proposed in our previous work to give a holographic derivation of the island formula for reflected entropy. More precisely, we demonstrate that the entropy calculated on the boundary side is equivalent to a bulk quantity called "defect extremal cross section" by combining the partial Randall-Sundrum reduction and holographic duality. We find perfect agreement in both static and time-dependent scenarios. This research leads to the publication 1.

### **Refected entropy of Hawking radiation** `2020.1 - 2020.6`

_Undergraduate Research    Advisor: Prof. Yang Zhou_<br>
We study the reflected entropy as a correlated measure of mixed states in the process of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we compute the reflected entropy between radiation and black hole in three different models and study its behavior in the whole evaporation process. Moreover, inspired by the recent island formula, we propose a generalized formula for reflected entropy with island cross section as its area term. This formula reveals some interesting information features of the island. This research leads to the publication 2.

### **Machine learning of phase transitions in spin models** `2017.1 - 2017.5`

_Undergraduate Research    Advisor: Prof. Yan Chen_<br>
We apply machine learning methods to study the phase transition in XY model and 3-dimensional Ising model. Samples of the model at different temperature, distributed on both sides of the critical point, are generated by the Monte Carlo algorithm. By exemplifying and simulating the XY model, we exhibit a new method, which integrates Monte Carlo, VAE and neural network algorithm to help describe the phase transition and accurately estimate their critical point.
